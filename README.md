About Mirha & Co.
Mirha & Co. began with a quiet observation that the smallest objects in a room often shape the way it feels.

In a world of fast production and disposable design, we are drawn to curated luxury interior décor that carries weight in material, in craftsmanship, and in presence. Sculptural home objects that do not demand attention, yet are never overlooked.

Our collection is guided by old-world forms, time-worn textures, and enduring materials. Each piece is acquired individually and selected for its ability to live effortlessly within modern heritage interiors while retaining a sense of history.

From artisan-crafted brass sculptures to vintage-inspired design objects, every form is chosen for permanence and presence. We believe collectible home décor should feel timeless, not seasonal.

No fleeting trends. No excess. Each one-of-one piece is acquired with intention and will not be restocked.
