          About Mirha & Co.
        </h1>

        <div className="space-y-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">

          <p>
            Mirha & Co. began with a quiet observation that the smallest objects
            in a room often shape the way it feels.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a world of fast production and disposable design, we are drawn
            to curated luxury interior décor that carries weight in material,
            in craftsmanship, and in presence. Sculptural home objects that do
            not demand attention, yet are never overlooked.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our collection is guided by old-world forms, time-worn textures,
            and enduring materials. Each piece is acquired individually and
            selected for its ability to live effortlessly within modern
            heritage interiors while retaining a sense of history.
          </p>

          <p>
            From artisan-crafted brass sculptures to vintage-inspired design
            objects, every form is chosen for permanence and presence. We
            believe collectible home décor should feel timeless, not seasonal.
          </p>

          <p>
            No fleeting trends. No excess. Each one-of-one piece is acquired
            with intention and will not be restocked.
          </p>
