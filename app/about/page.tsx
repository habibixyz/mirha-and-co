          <p>
            Mirha & Co. began with a quiet observation — that the smallest objects
            in a room often shape the way it feels.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a world of fast production and disposable design, we are drawn to
            pieces that carry weight — in material, in craftsmanship, in presence.
            Objects that do not demand attention, yet never go unnoticed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our collections are inspired by old-world forms, time-worn textures,
            and enduring materials. Each piece is thoughtfully selected for its
            ability to live effortlessly within modern spaces while retaining
            a sense of history.
          </p>

          <p>
            We release in limited quantities, choosing intention over excess.
            No seasonal noise. No fleeting trends.
            Only objects designed to age beautifully alongside you.
          </p>
